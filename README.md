# WordPress Starter SASS
This is a collection of SASS files, which include the following for use when beginning a WordPress Build.

* Bootstrap Grid (12 Col)
* WordPress CSS (for the CSS the editor adds in such as image alignments)
* Basic CSS for WordPress [Gallery](https://codex.wordpress.org/The_WordPress_Gallery)
* SASS Mixin Library
* Typography (With mobile, table and small desktop variations)
* Variables (Where a number of settings have been stored for easy customisation)
* Reset (Courtesy of Eric Meyer)

Feel free to use this as you wish. This is just what I use and I'll be updating this repo if I change anything in my processes. Create an issue if you come across any issues and I'll look at getting them fixed and added in.

Just in case anyone was wondering I build custom themes using [Underscores](http://underscores.me/), add this folder, add the SASS to [Koala](http://koala-app.com/) and begin the build.

## To do:
* Form CSS
* Create variable to toggle XL grid on and off

If you have any suggestions for additional elements to be added in, create an issue with a feature tag and I'll take a look :)

Have fun!
